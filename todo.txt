# other
- add backwards highlighting
- page up/down && maybe up/down doesn't reselect word if mouse didn't move
- mouse cursor: rect dimensions are not accurate after a zoomIn/zoomOut 
- some word highlighting is a bit off upon startup (it renders properly after a resize)
  maybe it has something to do with font size?
- remove and refactor util.go and util_test.go
- can we move case *sdl.MouseMotionEvent: check_collision_mouse_over_words(t, ctx, &word_rects, &mouse_over)
  stuff into case *sdl.MouseButtonEvent? We could technically just use X, Y coordinates,
  but it depends on behaviour we want.
